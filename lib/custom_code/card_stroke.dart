///
///   top edge,    left->right:  153 131 112  94  78  64
///   bottom edge, left->right:   63  56  49  41  38  39
///   left edge,   top->bottom:  129 119 108  99  90  81  73  65  62
///   right edge,  top->bottom:   57  53  54  49  47  46  46  45  43
///
/// A 180deg gradient would leave the top edge uniformly bright across its
/// width. It falls 153->64 instead, and the right edge is flat and dim because
/// it is already deep into the ramp. Brightest at the top-left corner, dimmest
/// at the bottom-right. Falloff measured 0.892/px horizontal, 0.547/px
/// vertical, which is atan2 -> ~121deg.
///
/// begin/end below encode that 121deg. For a clean 135deg (exact
/// topLeft->bottomRight) use (-1,-1) -> (1,1) instead.
///

/// The stroke is meant to dissolve, not outline. By the last stop it is 3%
/// opacity over a grey close to the card fill (the card gradient ends at
/// #181818), so the bottom edge reads as no border at all. A flat colour cannot
/// express this - it is either too bright at the bottom or too dim at the top.
///
/// Plain [Alignment], NOT AlignmentDirectional: the painter calls
/// createShader() itself, outside the widget tree, so there is no ambient
/// Directionality to resolve against. AlignmentDirectional asserts there and
/// the stroke silently fails to paint - "To resolve AlignmentDirectional
/// properties, it must be provided with a TextDirection."
